Through low-code automation and high-code programming, PiML support various machine learning models in the following two categories:\n","\n","- **Inherently interpretable models**: \n","  1. EBM: Explainable Boosting Machine (Nori, et al. 2019; Lou, et al. 2013)\n","  2. GAMI-Net: Generalized Additive Model with Struatured Interaction Network (Yang, Zhang and Sudjianto, 2021)\n","  3. ReLU-DNN: Deep ReLU networks using Aletheia unwrapper (Sudjianto, et al. 2020)\n","\n","- **Arbitrary black-box models**ï¼Œe.g.\n","  1. LightGBM or XGBoost of varying depth\n","  2. RandomForest of varying depth\n","  3. DNNs with softmax/tanh activations\n","\n","This example notebook demonstrates how to use PiML in its low-code mode for developing the above listed models, interpreting them and testing them. The toolbox has the following built-in datasets for demo purposes. \n","\n","- **CoCircles** classification data: simulated by `sklearn.datasets.make_make_circles(n_samples=10000, noise=0.1)`\n","- **Friedman** regression data: simulated by `sklearn.datasets.make_friedman1(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, and noise=0.1)`   \n","- **BikeSharing** classification data:  \n","- **CaliforniaHousing** regression data:\n","- **TaiwanCredit** regression data:\n","\n","Other details to add ...
