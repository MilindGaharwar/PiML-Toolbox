Through low-code automation and high-code programming, PiML supports various machine learning models in the following two categories:\n","\n","- **Inherently interpretable models**: \n","  1. EBM: Explainable Boosting Machine (Nori, et al. 2019; Lou, et al. 2013)\n","  2. GAMI-Net: Generalized Additive Model with Structured Interactions (Yang, Zhang and Sudjianto, 2021)\n","  3. ReLU-DNN: Deep ReLU Networks using the Aletheia Unwrapper (Sudjianto, et al. 2020)\n","\n","- **Arbitrary black-box models**ï¼Œe.g.\n","  1. LightGBM or XGBoost of varying depth\n","  2. RandomForest of varying depth\n","  3. Residual Deep Neural Networks\n","\n","This example notebook demonstrates how to use PiML in its low-code mode for developing machine learning models, interpreting them and testing them. The toolbox has the following built-in datasets for demo purposes. \n","\n","- **CoCircles** classification data: simulated by `sklearn.datasets.make_make_circles(n_samples=2000, noise=0.1)`; see [details](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_circles.html).   \n","- **Friedman** regression data: simulated by `sklearn.datasets.make_friedman1(n_samples=2000, n_features=10, and noise=0.1)`; see [details](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_friedman1.html).   \n","- **BikeSharing** regression data from UCI repository: consisting of 17,389 samples of hourly counts of rental bikes in Capital bikeshare system; see [details](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).  \n","- **CaliforniaHousing** regression data: consisting of 20,640 samples and 9 features, fetched by `sklearn.datasets`; see [details](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html). There are a raw version, a trim1 version (trimming only AveOccup) and a trim2 version (trimming AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population and AveOccup).   \n","- **TaiwanCredit** classification data fro UCI repository: consisting of 30,000 credit card clients in Taiwan from 200504 to 200509; see [details](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).
