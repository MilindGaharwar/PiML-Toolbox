# PiML-Toolbox

PiML (Python Interpretable Machine Learning) is a new Python toolbox for IML model development and validation. Through low-code automation and high-code programming, PiML supports various machine learning models in the following two categories:

- **Inherently interpretable models**: 
  1. EBM: Explainable Boosting Machine (Nori, et al. 2019; Lou, et al. 2013)
  2. GAMI-Net: Generalized Additive Model with Struatured Interactions (Yang, Zhang and Sudjianto, 2021)
  3. ReLU-DNN: Deep ReLU Networks using Aletheia Unwrapper (Sudjianto, et al. 2020)

- **Arbitrary black-box models**ï¼Œe.g.
  1. LightGBM or XGBoost of varying depth
  2. RandomForest of varying depth
  3. DNNs with softmax/tanh activations
